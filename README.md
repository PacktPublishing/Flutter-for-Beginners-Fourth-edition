The Fourth edition of <i>Flutter for Beginners</i> is fully updated for the latest Flutter and Dart releases, ready to guide you from taking your first steps in Flutter to publishing your first cross-platform app. Designed for new developers and those transitioning from other technologies, this practical guide shows you how to build, test, and release high-quality mobile apps for iOS, Android, and the web.</br>
With a project-based approach, this book will help you master the fundamentals of Dart and Flutter’s widget-driven architecture while building a complete app from scratch. Each chapter builds on the last with step-by-step explanations that will teach you how to design beautiful interfaces, manage state, handle navigation and user input, and add animations that bring your UI to life.</br>
You’ll explore popular third-party plugins such as Firebase and Google Maps, learn to debug and test your code effectively, and prepare your app for release on multiple platforms.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into sub-folders within either the lib or test top-level folders. For example, `Chapter01`.

The code will look like the following:
```
void main() {
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
print('hello ${i + 1}');
}
}

```

## Running the code
To run the code you will need to specify which chapter you wish to run, and which main method to run within the chapter, because the code is split by chapter and, in some chapters, there are multiple files with main methods within them.
Use the following command with the correct chapter number and main file name:  
```flutter run -t lib/Chapter01/main.dart```

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
To get started, all you need is to have access to a browser so you can use the DartPad website and play with Dart code. However, to develop a full Flutter app, you will need an **integrated development environment** (**IDE**) such as Android Studio or Visual Studio Code.
To professionally develop and publish iOS apps, you will need a developer license (paid annually), a Mac, and at least one physical iOS device to test your applications. Similarly, for
Android, you will need a developer license (one-off payment), but you can use any major operating system. All this is not strictly necessary for the purpose of learning Flutter, but if you aim to release an app at some point, then you will need to bear these requirements in mind.
The entire installation process and the requirements of the Flutter environment are available on the official Flutter website (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install), but do
not worry: you can start with the bare minimum and install any extras only when necessary.
